# Real Estate Price Prediction

## Overview

This project utilizes a linear regression model built in Python, specifically using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. The CrisDM lifecycle methodology guides the project, ensuring a comprehensive approach from data understanding to deployment.

## Data

The dataset focuses on Bangalore house prices. During the data understanding phase, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and cleaning were performed. The process involved checking data, summary statistics, data types, and addressing missing values. Feature engineering was conducted to enhance predictive capabilities.

## Model Development

In the model development phase, a linear regression model achieved an impressive accuracy of approximately 90%. K-fold cross-validation and grid search CV were employed to fine-tune the model and identify optimal hyperparameters.

## Web Application

The project extends to a Flask web application, combining server-side development with Python Flask and client-side development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Deployment

Deployment is the next milestone, with considerations for platforms like Heroku or Render. Follow the steps below for deployment:

1. **Prepare Clean Data**: Ensure the clean data file is ready for deployment.

2. **Deploy Model**: Utilize platform-specific guidelines for deploying machine learning models on Heroku or Render.

3. **Web App Deployment**: Deploy the Flask web application, incorporating both server and client sides.
